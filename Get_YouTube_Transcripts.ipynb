      "https://github.com/dalfredostrowski/dapp_deployment_react_fargate_demo, Transcript: hello everyone D Alfred ostrowski here and in this recording I'm going to be going through the basic mechanics of building and deploying a decorized react web application to AWS fairgate I'm starting with an ec2 C5 large instance with Ubuntu and I already have the associated libraries already installed on that instance and I'm going to start from the point of the create react app and I'm going to have all the steps that got me to this point well documented with the associated GitHub pet should be below this recording this is an overview of the steps I'm going to go through I'm going to work through the create react app the first step I've already installed reactive node and some of the other Associated libraries that I use with react I'm going to be adding two configuration files to do the docker build I'm going to build and test my Hello World react application is a Docker image I'm going to establish a registry with the elastic container registry on AWS and obtain the appropriate IAM credentials to do command line pushes push my darker eyes image to the registry from there I'm going to create a Target group an Associated load balancer this is going to give me access to the actual deployed application and I'm going to define a task definition and start a fair gate cluster gives me a serverless implementation and voids the details of cluster configuration I'm going to initiate a service inside of the fare gate cluster and test appropriately so let's get started I have a putty instance to the ec2 instance that I have already started let me just step through that again I have a C5 large instance and hopefully you have some familiarity with AWS already I use the Ubuntu and the default Ubuntu 2204 and I picked C5 as my instance type and I generally dissociated key pair so I'm ready to go I'm going to run V create react and create my application I'm going to be using here so I'm going to be dragging a lot of the commands I'm going to make sure these all available on the associated GitHub for you so you can duplicate exactly what I'm working through and I'm in the base home Ubuntu directory if I do the PWD so I'm going to create a react project called react Docker AWS now while I'm doing that I'm going to go to my ec2 instance and make sure that it is set up appropriately so when I build the docker image that I can run it in line and test it as such so I'm going to avoid doing that MPS test just for brevity here so I have my ec2 instance and again that is running in the background go to my instant types and I'm going to bring up my Associated instance and look at the security group now I need to set up a security group so I can access it and test my Docker files appropriately before I proceed so I'm going to go into security and check my security groups whoops lost money screen there for a second I'm going to set up three inbound rules maybe a little bit Overkill but this is going to get me through the entire deployment process so I'm in inbound rules click on my security group now I can edit my inbound rule so I'm going to create three inbound rules to do all traffic and I'm going to ip4 for the first and IP 6 on the second then I'm going to set up a third Rule and this is also going to be all traffic in this case I'm going to do a custom and I'm going to loop back to my security group this is going to get me through the figure cluster zero zero four nine let me scroll down to find that I have a ton of security rules here a lot of different instances you may not have as much so one second it's not going to be as hard to find okay let's see if I can find that here there it is okay so I search on that 498-479 so this is a loop back to the same security rules I'm going to save those rules and once I do the docker build and the image is set up then I can loop back to that you should have any problems at all and I can go back to my instance and get the DNS clicking under the details and I can put that in my buffer so I've created my react file and I'm going to create two additional files this is to be located on the GitHub and first I'm going to create some extra directories to put that in I'm going to create a conf directory CV to the cop and then I'm going to create another directory called conf.d and CD to that I'm going to create use the vi editor a default conf as such and and load in the associated configuration file it's going to allow the server to point that containerized file Port 80 and set up the appropriate appropriate directory locations for the use of ngex engine you drill back down to the main directory I'm going to create a Docker file and set up similar configurations to support that Docker build again all these files can be located on the GitHub and you don't have to pour over the video here you step through these very briefly if you want more detail there's a lot of more detailed information how Docker works here just want to get you up and running with the basic mechanics here I'm going to be using the 1650 Alpine library and set up the appropriate working directory and the associated environments and address the node modules that were associated with my react build do an npm build reference the entry extension with alpine and support update of the configuration files bring in static files set up a port at 80 and run the ngex engine so now at this point I am ready to do a Docker build and then we can test that I'm going to put sudo in front of the docker command so I'm going to do a pseudo Docker build Dash t reactable Docker AWS and Associate tag latest and the dot is going to address this to be done in the current directory which I'm in the current project directory so let's make complain a little bit and give me some warning files and once it completes then I'm going to test this directly in the directory in which it has been built and verify that I have a working Docker image file to be deployed to the fairgate cluster now the fairgate cluster again is going to give me a quick means of employing a serverless implementation that I don't have to worry about a lot of the configuration um activities that would be associated with a regular cluster deployment so this is almost done I'd go on a hold but it should be complete in just a few seconds following this I'm going to do a Docker run and that allow me to run the image inline directly from this directory and then I can grab that DNS from my cluster and touch the react web application from the browser and this is almost done looks like it's running appropriately take a few more seconds here and I look like I have a successful build and now I can run that I'm going to do a pseudo Docker run Dash p 3080 with the project name and latest tag so it looks like it's up and running I can bring in a browser and perform a test and grab the public IP address and I can pull in a different a new tab and I want to touch this from Port 3000 so now I have a successful Docker built and I'm able to access it from my PC2 cluster again the advantage here is that I'm doing this all within the AWS instances so I have a higher level of compatibility my Docker file with the firegate cluster implementation so I'm going to shut down this client and close stop running my Docker file and now I can start to get ready for the deployment to a fair gate cluster so to do that I'm going to need to establish an ECR elastic container registry a search on ECR to get to that you see I already have a few repositories I'm going to create a new one and I'm going to name it as a private Repository we call this react docker AWS let me call this Fair gate I don't think I have a name conflict and create that Repository now I want to highlight this I can click in I don't have any images so that's my next step is to generate the images and I have Associated commands that allow me to accomplish that before I do that I need to establish credentials to be able to empower the command line to perform these push commands to AWS is providing for me so I'm going to leave this here and just start a new tab and go to the directly to iam in my console and I can search on IM it's going to take me there of course I had it in my recently accessed you may not have it there so I'm going to the I identity access Management console I'm going to click on users and create a new user have any here so I'm going to start from scratch call this react AWS and I'm going to choose provide user access to AWS Management console and I want to create an IAM user I'm going to omit the identity Center and I'm going to create an auto generated password and I'm going to next through that I'm going to add this user to a group and in this case I don't have any groups so I'm going to create one so I'm going to call it's react Docker group and I only need one policy and that is administrator access and I'll click user group from that I can now select the group that I want to add the user to and move forward with that now it's going to give me everything for review and I'm going to create my user it's going to give me a username password for the console and download that I'm not going to be using that what I am going to be using is the specific password for the command line access so now I can access my username and I'm going to go to security credential I'll try to screen Channel these so you'll have a hard copy means of access so I have access keys I'm going to create an access key and let me click into that and I'm going to choose command line interface CLI and I'm going to understand the recommendations it stands for tag I don't need one I'm going to create the access key so it gives me an access key and a secret access key I'm going to go off screen and I'm going to save that information now so when I do a configure then I can reference that key that'll give me the logon capability so I have to be extremely careful with that and by no means do you want to show this to anyone or put it anywhere near a GitHub page that's definitely something that you add to it get ignore or omit completely so the next step before I do those push commands I'm going to do an AWS configure and it is going to prompt me for the access key for that I am going to go off screen to be able to accomplish that and I'll pause for a second I'll put the information in and then we will proceed okay did the AWS configure it asked me for the user credential and the secret password key I've entered that in also with the region and I defaulted the last prompt now I'm ready to to proceed with the configuration commands so the First Command that is presented here let me get back to that registry is doesn't work appropriately so I have a slight reformulation of that and I'm going to pull that in right here and I'm going to make this available so you can run this appropriately so here I'm going to instead of that login command provided I have a slight variation of that pseudo Docker login Dash uaws Dash p with the login information and the associated mnemonic so if you're going to need that and since I gave it the appropriate I am credential that login proceeded and I can move forward with the remaining commands and these work verbatim here I'm going to just do a Docker build again as proceeded but I need to use the pseudo as before the next command is going to perform the tag and now I can do the push it look like work appropriately let's go to the registry and make sure that it's there so let me refresh the registry it should be showing up at this point so now we have the registry setup and I have an Associated URI with that I'm going to be referencing that as I move forward so I built the image I established the ECR the IM credentials I push it so I might hit the Step 11 now I'm going to move forward and set up the target group and Associate the load balancer this is going to allow for the web-based access to the cluster once I have set that up appropriately so I broke down these steps in the context of building a load balancer I can create a Target group separated the two and then you can populate that Target group as I build the load balancer that way it's somewhat self verifying so let me go to ec2 and we can accomplish that so go back to ec2 and I'm going to scroll down here and it has Target groups I'm going to first create a Target group I don't have any established at this point I'm going to set it up as IP addresses everything else I'm going to default is in the HTTP Port 80 ipv4 hpv1 and it's going to whoops I have to give it a name so let me call it react AWS group and create my target group very good now I can create my load balancer and I'm going to create it as an application load balancer go there and I'm going to call it give it a name react AWS let's call it react AWS load balancer leave it as Internet facing foreign group and it has four mappings I'm in the west 2A so I'm going to choose all four subnets that are provided here fought my Security Group it has listeners and routing and here it's prompted me for a Target group going to select the target group that I just created now I could actually create the target group here again I prefer to break it down a little bit and do it beforehand that way I know in most cases that I have a that if I have created it correctly I can select it from the drop down and someone as I mentioned soft verifying there everything else is appropriate I can look at the summary it looks appropriately so I'm going to create my load balancer this will have its own DNS associated with and that's how I'm going to access the final deployed application now I'm going to create a task definition I'm going to do this under the ECS or elastic container service test definitions I'm going to create a new task definition just default and I'm going to call it react AWS task definition here it's going to prompt me for the URI that I used with my container registry so let me go back to that I can bring in a new Tab and I can switch through and pull up that URI so here is my registry and I'm going to copy that URI to pull that in to my test definition call this react AWS container I can move forward with that for my app environment I'm going to choose aws's firegate is a default I can go between ec2 or fairgate fargate's default if it's not you want to go back and choose for a game Linux and I leave everything else as a default storage I leave is the default monitoring and tagging I leave as a default and it should be good to create my look to answer me to review it and it should be appropriate and I'm going to do the creation now I can start my cluster let me go into cluster I'm going to choose create cluster call it react NWS cluster default to networking subnets are populated infrastructure is default AWS fairgate and it should be good to go this will take a few minutes to initiate and then the final step here is to initiate a service within the fairgate cluster and then I can test it by grabbing the DNS for my load balancer and open up yet another tab in the same fashion that I tested my Standalone image file let's give this a few seconds now if this takes 20 minutes or something in ordinate amount of time then something wasn't configured appropriately in some cases it may not give you an error so when they say a few minutes they mean it should only take a few minutes I'll go off a hold if this takes a little bit longer than usual but in some cases again you may not get an appropriate error message it looked like it started appropriately so I can click into my existing cluster and now I can create a service so I go to services and I do create existing cluster is set up here and I'm going to specify that task definition family and I can also see a service name for react let's call it react AWS service default accept for the load balancer I want to pull on that load balancer and make the association here and I want to use my exist I could create a new one but again I choose to make sure that I'm pulling in my existing load balancer listener and Associated Target group I can click down here click down and use the existing the react AWS group and now I should be good to create it scroll back up and this will take again an additional few minutes takes an inordinated amount of time you may have in there and it may not give you appropriate diagnostics for it while that's running I can start and ec2 reference and grab my DNS in anticipation of this running appropriately and I can grab the DNS for my load balancer so I can test that as soon as it is up and running so I'm going to click into the load balancer I don't even have to click in I can just grab that DNS copy name and let's see well the deploy the service looks like it's deployed appropriately and you can get additional information on it however I have a status as active everything is green Leaf is completed so let's test we deployed AWS fairgate cluster pull in a different screen and I don't believe I need the extra Port here and there you have it so successful completion so what do we accomplish here we created a create react the default react application we dockerize we put it in a Docker file built that image and tested it as such from an EC to C5 Ubuntu cluster then I established a container registry we obtain the appropriate IAM credentials to send it to The Host and establish it in the registry then I set up a Target group configure as an IP and the associated load balancer from there we create a task definition started the fairgate cluster and the associated service and from there we have tested it successfully as an AWS fairgate cluster thanks for listening I hope this helps all the associated information be in the associated GitHub with this recording good luck with it Take Care thank you\n"

      "#golf #MarkImmelman #PGA #PGATour #juniorgolf #golfpro #golftip #golfcoach, Transcript: I have been looking very forward to this conversation I've gotten to know Tim ish from my work on the golf course and the odd times that I was calling brass and dechamber and he was on the Satchel over there folks around the world is Tim Tucker Tim how are you man Welcome to our show I'm great thank you very much I appreciate you letting me speak on your show are you kidding me no worries I mean I I've watched you with such admiration from afar because look the the brass and dechambeau gig was challenging and and the Poise and the professionalism and just everything you did your your work with was always intriguing and and impressive to me and then you're a military guy too so I'm thankful for your service man thank you very much yeah my pleasure okay let's get into it for the folks who don't know Tim Tucker around the world a lot of the American fans do um tell us briefly the bio the story of how you got to where you are please sure yeah as you said you know I was in the military I grew up here in Amarillo Texas where I currently live I finally moved back here after being gone for 35 years but uh I went in the military I was in the Air Force um and I was on a rifle team for two years of the four which was really fun um and learned some great things about you know bullets and ballistics correct yeah which I was able to apply to golf with Bryson but uh you know then I got in the golf business I kind of fell into the golf business and was a was a club pro and ended up not really liking that so I started chatting at a resort called band of Dunes on the Oregon coast and fell in love with that lifestyle I was playing a lot of golf and trying to you know get my game together and I was playing a lot of competitive amateur stuff and and just having a blast with it and while I was chatting I was also doing some green reading uh I was teaching AimPoint I was fitting Putters for David Dell and you know an opportunity came along a friend of mine Mark McConnell hooked me up with uh with Tyler Aldridge he just got his card and asked me if I'd be interested in helping him because he needed some help on the greens and that's how I got my start on the PGA tour and but prior to that I'd met Bryson when he was 15 in Fresno with Mike shy and I taught him AimPoint okay so you can progress the name Point yeah when he was 15. and so I kept in touch with him because I thought he was really interesting you know he he a lot of people people know Bryson's really smart and he is and he you know he was at the top of his class in high school and and we had really interesting conversations which I I loved and you know because I'm a thinker too I I really like to think outside the box and so we hit it off really quickly but and so I kept in touch with him during you know the rest of his high school career and then in college you know I just I just call him here and here and there and I just see how he was doing yeah well when he came out on the tour after Augusta he played at uh Hilton Head and I happened to be there with Tyler and when I first saw him he just gave me a big hug and um you know I just I just check in with him every week and see how he's doing well I ended up you know quitting working for Tyler at Byron Nelson and I my dad had driven down from Amarillo to Fort Worth and or excuse me to Dallas and you know I just it wasn't working out for me and I said you know I'm just going to go back with you play golf for a week and then go back to caddy and abandon all right and on my drive back you know Bryson had let his caddy go that same week I didn't know that and got a call from him and said hey don't leave the state of Texas without talking to us and I ended up flying back to Colonial that next day and worked with Bryson and then that was it so that's my whole story well look now you're on Kurt katayama's bag and you know everyone talks about the influence of caddies and it's real I mean there's nothing like a wingman to use a an Air Force parlance you know you could be the case but having the wingman a key to your survival and and to me caddies are worth their weight in gold and I've watched you you know have an influence on Kurt kidayama that's been palpable and I'll get to that in a minute but before we do that um you know people want to know I want to know first off you know working for Bryson the demands are high you know the Bryson dechambeau I know they all have High um expectations but his come with a whole lot more information to have to provide and digest in a very short space of time under high pressure the decision making I can imagine Tim Tucker or even me facing off the yardage getting the number too Bryce and then he starts hitting you with questions and you're coming there with coherent correct answers all the time so talk about that some because I think there's real value that you can help people understand about that performing and deciding and being committed under pressure sure you know it was I would tell you it's pretty lucky how we as I look back on it how we got to you know through our process and you know a lot of this stuff was you know obviously we knew the green reading we spoke the same language on the greens but as far as as um you know our approach to you know once you know until we got to the green we really were kind of fumbling through it and his coach Mike shy at the time he said hey if you hit it one yard closer you'd be the best in every category in ball striking in Iron play approach to the green really okay and so you know I'm thinking I'm like how in the heck this kid works you know you know how part of these guys work on tour and it's like you know if he works two more spend some long arrows in the arc yeah he was he was that guy at one stage where the range lots and everyone was home I I'd left then they'd turn up Channel and there's Tim Tucker and Bryson dechamber on the Range still yeah I mean he he was this guy was driven to be perfect and and and the excellent golfer is and there's I don't think there's anyone that's ever put in as much work as this kid but um you know as part of that I was like how are we going to get him how are we going to get this extra yard you know it's not going to be through his practice it's going to be through US understanding how far the ball is actually going and so I started to apply you know some of the stuff I learned in the Air Force too the ball flight and as we started paying attention to that we developed this really cool process um and of being precise as far as the ball flying different distances at different times of the day understanding green density and how much the ball will release knowing that it's predictable yeah um through preparation and so as we started to do all these things we came up with this really great method and approach to you know how we got the yardage and and what we did and what I found is that that made him Focus that made him uh feel more confident with the shot we were going to hit because we hit every single checkpoint and it was just a process that we walked through and I really think that you know that helped him stay in the moment and commit to the shot every single time there is no doubt to that you know because I'm a recovering former college golf coach for a while and and you know this I've always maintained golf was like 90 pure panic and 10 Pure Pleasure and when you're in adolescent uh those numbers are 37 because of pressure and expectation and all this sort of stuff but when I walked with a player as soon as we got to the ball I'd start hitting him with what's your carry number how far is it going to go you know have you kept data on how far the ball's been traveling through the day and it's like you occupy their minds with this stuff like you're saying with Bryson and all of a sudden they might make a poor decision but at least there's some commitment to it and there's real value in that don't you think I couldn't agree more I mean you're 100 right whether it's the wrong decision or not you know we don't know it at the time so he's fully committed right we only know after the shot whether what we did was right and uh but yes being 100 committed and like you said as soon as you start hitting them with the information their mind you know focuses on the task at hand and not about what's really going on out out there and I think that's huge yeah it's fascinating um I have to ask you know because you know it almost became a meme at one stage and I was there because some with Bridgestone I might have been I think it was a TOUR Championship back in the day and you guys were spraying golf balls with uh um like a sprayer to just get some moisture on it you see the performance of the thing and I was like and as much as what folks are joking about this this is genius and this to me now sounds like your influence you know understanding how the ball is going to perform in wet conditions versus dry humid not humid that sort of thing correct absolutely you know and I'll give you a great example so we were at Hilton Head one year again I love that place but uh we were on the eight we just walked off the seventh green par three and we're going to the eighth hole it's a dog leg left four par tough hole and you know they're just it was a beautiful day but there was just a cloud that came over and just started spitting Mist down on us well I popped the umbrella immediately he teed his ball up I held you know it over so there wouldn't be any water on the ball he hit his shot and you know we were playing with Matt Couture and CT pan they didn't even have their umbrella so but it wasn't even a thing it was just a little bit of mist on the ground well when we got to our ball we could see you know the grass was shiny and wet well for us with an eight iron Bryson loses three percent of his carry distance when the ball's wet because the spin rate increases all right so the pin was was front right it was six Paces on and we factored that in and he hit his shot and it was pinheim he made birdie Kutcher and CT pan both missed the green short and I believe it's because their spin rates increase and the ball didn't go as far but we knew that we knew that that happened and so that's through that testing and understanding what happens to spin rates in all conditions in Turf you know whether there's moisture on the ball or different Turf conditions Sandy wet sand um you know dry grass dry you know all the things different types of dirt all those things affect how the ball spins let's put Tim Tucker on everyone who's listening to this or watching it on YouTube's bag okay all right travels farther in warm conditions shorter in cold conditions that everybody knows sadly most golfers watching this don't really pay attention to it okay not dry versus humid conditions which which one has the golf ball going farther so what happens is let's so I'm going to use uh two locations all right so last week we were down in Austin Texas okay and in the morning so let me back up okay there's three things that affect ball flight okay we have altitude we have temperature and we have humidity or barometric pressure okay well those three things combined give you a density altitude so for example in Amarillo Texas where I live we're at 3 500 feet okay yeah but when it's 80 degrees our density altitude is 6 500 feet so we're so where most people would play Hey I come to Amarillo it's 3 500 feet I'm going to play the increase of 3 500 feet versus sea level when it's actually 6500 which is another six percent and so that's a big one in itself and then temperature and then there's another way that we do that we include that density altitude but we also readjust for temperature so for Kurt in the morning when we first teed off one round it he would hit his 600 191 yards by the end of the round four hours later he hit it 211. so I'm sorry excuse me 206. 13 yards no hold up and most folks here's one of them luckily when I've got the uncrossed microphone I'd be like he's really jacked up and the ball's going farther but it's actually just it's some adrenaline but it's also the conditions correct yes you know people we've all done this playing golf it's like boy the ball is really going far today yeah it is because the conditions have changed right or the ball is really going short today well that's because it's colder and the density altitude has dropped yeah you know people say oh when I get to the coast uh the wind is stronger you know then or the wind affects the ball more here than it does in the desert well it's because the density altitude is down and the ball is not going as far but we just attribute that to the stronger wind love it okay so try wispy grass that thing's gonna come out of there with the little gas uh moist grass come out come out a little slower yes yeah I mean the thing you know it's so funny working for Bryson I really I didn't realize this until after I catty for Adam Spencer for a season and it finally hit me I don't know why I was like I called Bryson and told him about I'm like man we're stupid but um anytime you're in the rough yeah the ball is coming out with less spin yes always but it's it's the moisture in the grass that's making it fly or not right or the reduction in swing speed or ball speed so you know what we do is we we do this test every week where we go we put a ball in the rough we go good lie average lie bad lie and we hit three shots and we understand how much each one of those shots is gonna how far it's Gonna Fly and so it's when we're in the rough it's predictable yeah and so I'll give you a good example we were at Colonial one year Bryson's on the fifth hole and hits it in the left rough and we had 215 in and this is before he got really jacked up but we knew the ball was if we had a good lie in the rough it was going to jump 35 yards and I said I've seen some lies around Colonial but the thing looks like it'll never hit the ground ever yeah exactly and I told him I go we did the testing we know this is going to jump 35 yards he's like I can't believe I have to hit a nine iron here I'm like hit a 900 hit it 15 feet and you know how hard that hole is and he and he made birdie and it's like we would have he wanted to hit a seven iron and we would have flown you know we'd have flown to the 13th T so but just doing that preparation and it doesn't take long but again that's if we're gonna play in the tournament we're going to go there to win we need to do these little bitty things that only take 10 or 15 minutes each week but they're massive in how we prepare okay you and I are both flat scope guys I'm I'm assuming you were because of Bryson um yes love flight school they've got that environmental Optimizer on the X3 yes you can plug in whatever atmospheric or air dens I think air density was the term you used conditions and it'll predict for you how your golf Ball's Gonna Fly AI it's sounding to me like after listening to you that this is almost mandatory for anyone who wants to play the game any better yes absolutely it's a it's a you should know it and so Henry Johnson the owner of flight scope has been a massive supporter of of Bryson the tour and and me he's really helped me um actually we're working on a project together right now but yes Henry I helped Henry with the information on that how we were doing it and then you know Henry is obviously a brilliant man so he figured out all the actual math behind it and so that the flight scope will you know connect to the local weather station and give you all this data every second which is brilliant and the flight scope is a is the best product on the market in my opinion um amen so and I love what Henry did with that and now he has made it available for everybody to go out and do this and it sounds difficult I had a cat he talked to me and he said man I'd really like to learn what you're doing and I started telling him he goes man that sounds like a lot of work and I said man it is but it is vital for your golfer well you know I I it gets kind of back and I hope we've sort of answered all the questions because I was just asking now like a fan who knew enough to be dangerous but didn't really understand the true ballistics of it all um but you're you're kicking off point where you're like if Bryson just hit the ball a yard closer from every distance he'd basically be leading all stroke scan approach categories and golf is a game to me of distance and Direction where most golfers are worried about Direction but it's the distance not too long long and short and the control thereof that's kind of you know getting that hand grenade close to the Target kind of thing yes no question about it you know that's something that that you know I've worked with Kurt on insane we can always be sure we are never going to be long we've been long one time one round or excuse me one hole where where it's hurt us and I'm and you know a lot of time and I tell them man we can oh as long as you stay in front of the hole we're okay you know we can have a 30-footer we cannot have a shot that goes five yards long to a back pin where we can't get up and down I'd rather have the 30-footer you remind me of another great Texan like yourself Ben hurgan who was quoted a paraphrase where Hogan's like backflags always going a little lower so the ball can skip up and if I miss it short forward flags are going a little higher you know to have the thing settle down um so I want to make that a lesson for the the fans listening because for you guys at the highest level on the PGA tour you know they're in that place where they hit the ball far enough where they kind of know what their numbers are so they can't afford to leave the ball 35 feet short but the golfer at large listening to this I would say pretty much on average it's the ball short of where it should be so what would your advice as a caddy be to someone who you're caring for because every amateur I teach and watch man they they thinking they hit the ball father than what they actually do correct they do they always think they hit it further for sure yeah so one thing too one they don't know how far they hit it exactly and two they don't also they also don't know how far they hit it at certain times of the day which is really easy to do but what I would encourage every player to if they really want to get better is go to your go to your Club Pro find someone with a flight scope find out how far you hit each shot at a certain time of day I think just that in itself and then secondly I would make sure that your iron gapping is perfect that it's that it's symmetrical yeah and that's really important there are many Pros I come across that I've helped with you know that their iron gapping is not consistent so let's imagine and if people don't understand what that is let's say that uh for Kurt he has 13 yard gaps between each Club okay so if he hits an eight iron 180 he hits a 700 193. mm-hmm okay and so think about this if my gapping is not perfect right and I say hey I'm in a three-quarter of this shot well three quarters of you know taking the three-quarter shot with a 13-yard gapping or a three-quarter shot with a 10 yard gapping is different distances yeah so I can't take off a little this you know I can't go hey I'm gonna hit a three-quarter shot here and expect the same result if my gapping is not equal because I know that a lot of people do that I'm going to hit this a three-quarter shot well how far is that going if I don't know my gapping is consistent then a three-quarter shot with my seven iron maybe you know 185 but with a 10 yard gapping it would be you know 182 and the three yards could be the difference between you know birdie bogey par whatever you sound like the Reverend Tim Tucker I joked with you before we went on the air but it's it's true man um and two that's you know while we're punting flat scope I see a lot of amateurs they're like well my firewood goes as far as my three wood and I'm like yeah because you don't have speed enough to keep the Three Wooden there so to your gapping thing this is where you start to modify the club setup in the bag because for a large majority of these folks they'll probably hit their short irons a little longer and when they get to six five four those things don't do as much as what they think it does in the air it's more carry and roll let's say you right yeah exactly and you could you know you're exactly right in that and you could say hey I'm gonna take my five iron out because perfect gapping would be six to four right and then I can add you know a 5 wood or or whatever and having the proper gapping is just it's it's fun to know this stuff but it you'd be shocked at how much it will help you during your rounds you know what's so it is it is fun and it's fun to hear you go well dang your five iron doesn't go what it should stop wasting the space in the bag with that club take it out your gap between six and four will suffice and now you can add something else another weapon in Your Arsenal yeah I mean this is what people don't know about Bryson is that we we go to a tournament site and he always wanted so I guess the industry standard is if you have a seven iron you want to spend seven thousand carpinums yeah and eight arm would be eight thousand Bryson always wanted his 800 under the number so if it were a seven iron he wanted to spend 6200. okay and he was able to do that because he hit it so high and could still stop the ball but he did that because when it got wet it would spin 7 000 and not balloon so we'd go to different golf courses and the spin rates wouldn't match so we'd just go bend the clubs to whatever spin rate we wanted it that week so his Lofts were all messed up but they were correct for the spin rates and gapping and we do that every week and it didn't matter what the the number on the club was it was how far it went and he wanted that performance to be perfect you know Bryson gets and something I also want to point out about Bryson is that people Bryson is a perfectionist yeah he does not accept excuses and what's amazing about that is he's an amazing boss in that that way is that you figure it out okay there are no excuses I don't want to hear you know we didn't know or I want to know hey we missed that why and how are we going to fix it and you know him being that demanding is what you know helped make me the you know the Cadia I am and the cool thing is it shows that it does transition to other players and not just Bryson and so I got to get Bryson a lot of credit in that fact of being you know what people would say the hard ass he he knows how to bring out the best in people around him and if you weren't willing to make that commitment you couldn't work for Bryson and so regardless of all the crazy stuff that happened he's he he was tremendous in that aspect and a great leader in that aspect you're a great man for identifying that uh you you truly are um and you know just because I need more stuff to do I'm a volunteer assistant coach for a high school golf team my daughter plays in it and I kind of gave them that lecture a little bit yesterday afternoon now look this is not these girls are okay a couple of them good but I was like stop hitting and hoping at least know something because most golfers they get over it they pull a club they probably got the young wrong yardage they haven't considered how far the boss going or any of this sort of stuff how how are they hitting it on the day and they just pull out their seven iron and they just hit away hoping for a result and what they're gonna get is that hopeful kind of a result but if you sort of know something and you just do that properly you setting yourself on the course to success would you agree 100 and this stuff just you know a little bit more effort you know Bryson always and he would agree he he said you know Tim I was never good enough physically you know I didn't have the skill level that most other players I was playing against had so I had to either work harder or I had to think differently and that's really what started him on that journey of getting into the green reading and then accepting the fact that hey let's try this you know I'd I'd take stuff to them all the time these ideas I had and he'd say let's try them it was never like that stupid all right let's try it see if it works and if it didn't work we threw it out if it worked we put it in and he was super open-minded about that and I think anybody that's successful you have to be open-minded yeah and sometimes things will feel uncomfortable but that's where growth happens in that sort of situation where you're uncomfortable absolutely you talked about your skills parlaying and it certainly did and I'll set this up and I'll let you talk us through it um I believe it might have been maybe in a Saturday or the Sunday uh it was on the 17th hole at the API the Arnold Palmer Invitational here in 2023. and I was on the call for PGA Tour live in studio so we had you guys on the tee there it may have been Saturday now that our my memory is coming back to me but there was swirling wind the whole location's in the back there this part three is mean and it sits in an angle to you and so if you carry it down the road it's a longer carry and it was just a tough situation and guys were missing long and short and left and right and no one was finding the target Kurt gets up there kirayama and I can see is a little uncomfortable and he's in the routine and he pulls out and you pull the bag and you stand next to him all of a sudden I see you go to the book and you start to point stuff to him and I can not hear you talking but I'm like there's the long yardage there's the short yardage winds from here and you essentially convinced him that seven iron or whatever it was was the correct Club and all of a sudden this guy that looked like he was kind of during the headlights a little bit turned into Superman and delivered this beautiful seven iron in their 2015 feet or whatever and I if I was there I would have hugged you man because it looked like you just asked to just clear up the Clutter so I want you to talk about that please because most golfers when they're hitting they're just like there's like it's like inside the hen house you know there's just noise and cackling and stuff everywhere no Focus yeah sure you know I just again we just kind of rebooted um I walked him through the process again you know Kurt is an amazing he's an amazing guy I can't speak highly enough about him his iron play is Elite you know Bryson was one of the best iron players I'd ever seen in my life and I would put Kurt right in that category I think he's a top 10 ball Striker on tour his his Precision with the irons is blew me away I did not expect that when I started working for him and so it makes it easier to know how good he is with that right and you know as a player a lot of times like I knew that was I knew the club would carry If he if he executed and he did um and again just walking him through that process and convincing him hey man this is where we are this is how far this club's going right now and he and I know I told him I said I promise you this is the right club and uh and he believed me and he hit it and you know again all the credit to him for executing the shot that's actually the hard part and uh and dead and you know it was it was an amazing week and this kid has the guts like it's unbelievable how how he was able to make that putt on 17 to take a One-Shot lead and then to execute on 18 coming down you know as you know that Golf Course is brutal and it was set up like a U.S open and he he had the guts to to reach deep down and and do it and I asked him after I said man how nervous were you he said you know I was more nervous on the three footer I had on one than I was on that putt on 18. and that shocked me um so these guys you know Bryson used to do it too I didn't just like I don't know how you I don't know how you have the balls to to pull that shot off it was impressive and you know your brother and you I mean you played Collegiate golf you're a three-time All-American like it's you you guys have a special quality in you that lets you gives you that ability to focus and pull out these shots when no one else can and that's why you're a lead apparently you've done your research on me a little bit uh um I well I go to ask this then as a caddy because everyone says to me is like man I'd love to caddy caddy must be the greatest if you ever carried I'm like yeah I've carried and I hated it and I was always an instructor now a broadcast guy you speak of nerves I mean I remember calls I would make when I'd make a caddy and you'd like you convinced of this stuff but when they're over the ball you're like just please carry or just be you know and the ball's in the air and you're like no Gus kind of thing do you have those moments you know when you make the convinced call and your guys over it and you pull the bag away and you stand and they're going oh sweet Jesus please let this be the right Club of course absolutely you know I mean you know our job as a caddy is to assist the player and not hurt him you know and this is really funny my first week with Kurt happened to be at the at uh waste management and we played Four we teed off in the afternoon and we only played 14 holes it was due to Darkness uh we got called off the course and Kurt was six over in our opening round and I called his agent which is a friend of mine and I called Kurt's brother Daniel and I texted Kurt and I said man I could not help you today you did not have your best stuff but I hurt you I cost you shots I didn't help you one bit when it was going sideways and I said I'm embarrassed and I apologize for that and it won't ever happen again or at least I hope it never happens again and we went out the next day and um he he played 22 holes and shot you know had nine birdies and got it back to even par and I and I was just impressed with his fight but I hurt him that day I didn't help him I couldn't help him you know write the ship and save the shots it was like when I was when he hit it good I was wrong with the wind and when he hit it you know bad it didn't matter and and it was like the worst feeling I'd ever had on a golf course and especially our first round together right and then you know the next day it just all worked but um you know our job as a caddy is to make sure that player that we're helping him not hurting him and so according back to answer your question it's like yeah I pray that that's the right club and that we made the right decision together you know hindsight in golf is terrible you know we make the best decisions that we can make at the time and then we have to accept those and move on so you know and I and I try and put it that way if I'm wrong I call it out hey Kurt terrible Club I did that at the 11th hole uh that last week at Austin he hit it over the back of the green and I was like I hope TV picked it up because I was just like well that was the terror that was the wrong club that was terrible you know and if I don't call it out then the player can lose confidence in me you know you have to own your your errors that's what makes you better yeah there's Liberation and Truth isn't there and and and and and and any decisions better than no decision I think too many Club golfers are playing golf with no decisions they could see a ball and hit a ball and that's about the extent of it okay you've had me fascinated and so I've lost time so we've got to scoot through this stuff a little bit I do want to get one or two course management lessons for Augusta National next week where your guy I think is for Real the way it's the irons as long as what he is uh with you on the bag I think that's a weapon but before before there you're an expert green reader you kind of touched on it you have this very cool ball marker called the true aim I want you to show folks this because in my experiences most golfers under aim putts I I have rules in golf and you know the one of the rules is I've never seen a ball fall up a hill the slope chance to do its thing so so talk about your ball marker it's inspiration how it came about and how it works please yes sir so this ball marker is called true aim and I'll show you a picture of it there can you see that yeah I can for the folks listening on audio only it's it's milled steel it's kind of an almost a rectangular shape with a little uh Chevron at the top and some lines that are essentially like aiming lands am I correct correct yeah there's there's one the center line is um what you would reference for a straight pot yeah so kind of the process with this if you can imagine um name a hole on a name a course that you know better than any other and a hole on that course well Augusta National uh I'm good how about number 11. I'm calling it Corner shots next week sorry number 11. number eleven okay perfect and what pin do you want to use uh that nasty one uh let's let's go front leftish Okay good left Cuban West but front left yes okay so now tell your your listeners to do the same thing pick a course that they know better than any other okay and imagine pick a pen and we hit this ball 10 feet right or left of that pin so for the 11th hole at Augusta we're going to hit it 10 feet right out of the flag so a great shot in and but does yes so what we do is we Mark our ball and then we we take the our line on the ball and we aim it at the dead center of the hole okay that'd be the very first process first first step and then we use the shaft or a reference some reference to make sure it's aimed perfectly at the center so I always hold the shaft up to my dominant eye and look at it and make sure that the ball you think folks must have the line drawn with the Sharpie on their golf ball too for this to work I do and here's why I tell you I played 30 years of golf without a line and as soon as I put a line on my ball I realize how to give an idiot I was okay and the reason I say that is is there's there's a feedback loop a friend of mine Jason Goldsmith he's a he's a performance coach and he works with several players on tour and he explained this to me and as soon as I started doing it it was it was immediate Improvement but you know when we hit a putt we know if I'd hit it the right distance right if you're whatever your delivery speed is if you hit it that far past and if you miss the putt you know it was perfect speed but you don't know where we start our putts and if we have a line on our ball and the line rolls perfectly end over end I know that I hit it with a square Club face so the chances are I started it online so understanding that when I hit a putt and I don't see the ball roll end over in it tells me that I didn't hit it with a square Club face and that I did not make a good stroke but if I do see that line roll end over in regardless of what else happens I know that I've executed perfectly so it's a great feedback mechanism so I do encourage the line and to use this process you must use the line all right okay so we line our ball up at the dead center of the hole and then we the center line on the marker we match to the line on the ball so all this process is really is we're aiming the marker at the center of the hole all right okay now there's four angles left of straight and four and four angles right as straight and I classify these as the first angle is flat or subtle brick the second angle is average or obvious break the third angle is steep and the fourth angle is severe or Max break we've all hit putts we said oh that broke off the planet that would be our fourth angle so we're going to use we have nine nine angles we're going to use a process of elimination to get down to the correct number or the correct angle so the first question is is this putt in your mind is it straight or does it break it breaks it breaks so we've eliminated the straight if it were straight we'd put it back down on the straight the the center line in putt so now we know it breaks we've eliminated that angle which way does your putt break well that putt that I'm talking about is downhill and from right to left brakes to the left so we've eliminated the four right angles now we're using the four left angles of straight to project it out to the right okay now because we have four or more angles we're going to try and eliminate two of them and we say is this putt not uphill downhill but side the side slope is it flat or steep it can only be one it's the side angle um or does it break a lot or a little there's another way it breaks a lot it breaks a lot so we've eliminated our first angle which is flat and our second angle which is average so now we're on steep and severe now would you say that this putt breaks steep or is it severe steep steep so I'd put the now I'd put the line the line of my ball down on the third angle pick my mark up and putt it's so you know what it's so easy because there's a process of elimination to me again I'm a big one on conviction you get this conviction about you but now are you going to get there and when Trevor my brother won the Masters I gave him a similar putting lesson on the Monday morning and all we were doing was picking start lines and all he had to do was roll the ball over his intended start line and when I tested him on the green you know the green there right next to 10. behind one tier Nick to ten T right yes you know the left side of the Green close to 10 it falls away from you it's impossible so I'm like the hardest part on the green he goes over there it's downhill it's left to right nasty and so I'm like okay where do you want to hit this and he said X I'm like so I put a ball marker one of those plastic ones not your fancy one down on the line three feet in front of him I'm like hit it over that marker is that your line he goes yeah over the line Miss so I was like is that a good Putt and he goes I guess didn't go in and so I'm like well move your marker and he did and he hit the next one over the marker all rolled over and still missed I'm like was that a good pattern he goes I see where you're going and it gets into the green reading thing and starting the ball online like you're saying too but when you start to do that and you see the start lines then there's an element of freedom to the whole thing too so you know where you're going but here's the whole thing though you've got to trust this stuff and so many golfers get over the 3M thing with your ball marker that they've got and they look in the butthole sitting over here and they're like this is wrong and then they react give your tag there please yes I would and so what I would say is our subconscious is always aware our subconscious can is a super computer that can do anything millions of things our conscious mind kind of gets in the way of that sometimes so what I tell people when they select an angle I tell them never to reference where it's aimed I tell them to set into it with the line on the putter with a line on the ball look at the hole for distance and putt okay and keeping in mind all we're trying to do is roll the ball end over in if you stand back and look where that angle is pointed you're always going to disagree with it because our brain can't do the complex math and we always under read putts Dave Pell's proof that many other instructors prove that you know that I know that I think that we I don't think this I know this we are better Putters than we think we are and we are worse green readers than we think we are most people are the opposite so they say oh I'm a good green reader and a terrible Putter and I'd say no that's not true the putting stroke is really short and easy to execute it's the easiest stroke to execute yet we struggle with it and I think the reason is is because we're not picking the right line which affects how much speed we play to correct for that misalignment for under reading we hit it further you know for for overreads we hit it softer so when we have the correct angle the correct read our speed improves immediately so I tell people you're not a bad putter you're just not following your feedback loop of and you're not reading greens properly this marker cost a hundred dollars and I'll tell you a story this guy called me and said hey do you offer discounts he he sent me an email and I said I said why don't you call me and I'll explain this to you I bought a driver about two months ago for six hundred dollars and I was walking out of the golf shop at my club and I said this driver will never save me one shot it will only cost me shots my marker will never cost you shots will only save you shots and I said you know I should be selling this for 600 but if I were even at 100 people are like very wary of the fact that this works and I said I told this guy I said I should sell it for 600 it's already discounted 500. and he bought one and he's a massive fan of it and I my feet the feedback from this has been amazing and I'm not trying to be a big salesman here I want to help people just like you be better golfers this tool is a phenomenal tool it's probably the most important piece of equipment in your bag I will contend and and you've been very involved in Stark scan given the folks you've worked with especially some guy whose name rhymes with brass and dechambeau um I I the key to good scoring is turning three Strokes into two Bobby Jones and I'm getting to Augusta National here shortly and three Strokes into two means you're good at stroke number three and if you do all third Strokes bunker shot pitch shot wedge shot put stroke if you do them well you're going to make a lot of threes and fours if you do the shot number one well you're probably gonna make fewer sixes and sevens so if you want to litter your scorecard with small numbers do shot number three will and I was so Keen to get you because I can't tell you how many folks I see then they wreck away those shortcuts that they never make then they have to make one all of a sudden in the member guest and they miss and then they're like oh I drove it great I'm like yeah but that's not where the hole ends man yes I couldn't agree more people don't realize what a great Putter bruss and dechambeau was one of the best in the world yeah he was I think it was funny he he struggled with putting immediately on tour but then you know his he was a top 20 putter on tour and obviously the longest off the tee so deadly combination is why he was so great but yes he and you know here's the other thing he never practices putting he worked on his speed control religiously right but like during covid he didn't hit one Putt in a hundred days he did not hit one Putt and he went to Colonial and finished third um and uh what's that tell you he didn't practice putting he didn't touch his putter for a hundred days and went out and won and almost won a Tour event so it's he he has his stroke locked in he works on speed control every week he probably practices putting two out not even probably an hour and a half a week and that's all primarily speed control and rolling the ball ended over end I watched you guys um at East Lake the Tour Championship the one time it's got a beautiful putting green there with a lot of tilt down toward the water and it's almost like you guys could predict how far the ball was gonna roll and I briefly asked him and he goes yeah we have a system and I was like you can't just share and he's like not so much but anyway it was all about speed control and on those super fast screens it looked like everyone else there was a bit of frat Factor on the go where he looked almost like he could put confidently even though there wasn't a bunch of friction on the greens that week yes we always made sure that the greens were running 11 stamp in his mind so if the greens were slower I'd make adjustments so we did yardage on every putt okay and so like a good example would be let's say that he had a a 20-footer and he were coming down to the straight at a 45 degree angle on a two on a two percent slope right if you were straight down the 20-footer on a on a on an 11 Step green right he would hit that putt 12 feet but because he was at the 45 down angle we'd always just do the math and adjust and he'd have to hit that you know 80 of the way so I'd say hey Bryson we're coming down the 45 on our two percent I need to hit this 16 feet and then because he knew the ball speed for every Putt and the length of stroke that it took he'd be able to execute that so we always did yardage on the green as well and by the way folks ball speed on the greens is a big thing get yourself a flat scope for that as well okay right Tim I've kept you for so long um we're gonna have to do a green reading podcast at some stage on a week off we loved it um Augusta National you've given away one of the keys already uh you know still in Kurt to put up hill um the course management around that place I feel like is is something that's overlooked you know you can't bludgeon the place to death you've got to there's Nuance around there and you've got to hit the ball well you've got to basically do everything well but some course management lessons one or two maybe three as you look forward to the Masters next week please yes sir you know I it really gets back to almost every tournament in in the fact that you know during Arnold Palmer we had perfect numbers it seemed every hole and Kirk could hit full shots and be aggressive well then on Saturday he ended up shooting even par and it's like we walked off the course and I go man you played so great we just never really had a number where we could be aggressive to a hole so we had to be conservative and because the number didn't match the shot that we wanted to hit and so at Augusta it's very penal the greens are so undulated you can be in the wrong spot and be out of position and and make in three putt or or hit it off the green um and so I would you know when you can when you have the perfect number and have the opportunity to be aggressive be aggressive when you don't have the perfect number you have to play very conservative to the right spot of the green so I think that's one big thing one one big one there and then secondly the wind and the wind is really tough you know when we play the same Golf Course all the time you know your listeners are playing the same golf course yeah you know all the nuances of the win but when you're at a place for a week and you're only seeing one win for you know most of the week and then all of a sudden you get a win coming out the other Direction you don't know how it swirls through the trees it's really difficult and so there are some some secrets to Augusta as you know you know on on 12 you want to you know you need to look at the 11th flag and and see what it's doing to make your decision there's a there's an Eddie effect that comes you know down 13 and then it starts to come up and work up 11. and it also happens on four which I think four is the hardest part three in golf to me and again you'll see the flag on three blowing left to right and so but you're feeling it in the face because it's coming up five just like it is three and then working down four and it plays into the wind even though the flag on three is showing left to right or even down and it's so the wind is very tricky at Augusta and you need to make sure again because the severity of the misses you need to make sure that you're you're trusting what the wind is doing that you know what the wind is doing and then if you don't know you need to hit less Club to try and or you know more flighted shot with less spin so that the ball gets there even if I do miss miss the wind yeah that's something that people don't realize is how many shots you have to create Around Augusta National because there's an area flat spot on the place I mean you've got 18 teen grounds that are flat and otherwise you you're having to finagle something absolutely I think too another thing too and you know Kurt's starting to understand this is that you know Bryson we'd take levels out and measure the fairways and go hey you know in this landing area we're on a three percent downslope which if we're hitting a pitching wedge you know now it's three degrees delofted and it's going further or we're on a two to two percent uphill slope or two degree uphill slope this you know shot's going to come off with less you know these little bitty things and it doesn't look like much but you know again the Precision with your iron play is is going to be the key that and putting of course actually all of it like you said I keep telling people that you have to be a good iron player and a good putter but then you have to drive it perfectly too there's no the course looks when you're walking around it on paper looks simple but it's just not and then you add to that the gravitas of the moment and the Press yeah that that's one of those immeasurables that even you can't get the math for huh correct yes and I you know I tell Kurt and I'm like you know everybody prepares for Majors different and I'm like there's no he wanted to go back out there or they talked about going out on Monday last Monday and playing around and I was like man I'd rather you just rest look you've never seen Bay Hill you played it perfectly and won the tournament there's no reason why I I can't go out get my work done you rest we'll see the golf course it's just like any other golf course we have to execute and don't build it up more than it should be you know people I I used to do that when I would play you know I'd play in a big tournament and I'd put all this pressure on myself to to execute and I couldn't because it was I made it bigger than it should have been golf is oh you know Bryce we always talked about it's just grass and Air right and we're playing the course not you know we're playing the course yeah I can't help that someone shot eight under we just need to do our thing yeah one more question then I'll let you share an address where folks can get your marker and I'll let you go thank you for all your time um the raised Creek effect it's the lowest part on the golf course I will make a comment about it and this one looks like it's right to left but raised Creek is over there and the ball doesn't do what player is expecting and then I get ripped on social media saying you smoking stuff Mark talk about the fact that in your yardage book everyone has a DOT on the green that shows the direction of where race Creek is please yeah absolutely my yardage books are right over there I could open up and show you a highlight where raised Creek is and here's here's it's not that raised Creek has an effect it's that there are optical illusions and that that the ball is always going to the low Point gravity is always taking the ball a good example is the 17th green there is a middle right pin on 17. if you watch this telecast the pin will be there probably on Sunday but anybody putting from the the pin is Middle right 117. you will see everybody run that ball by six eight feet it's freaking fast and it looks like it's I know the one you're talking about and it looks uphill and it's lightning fast and but it's downhill because Ray's Creek is that way and it's an optical illusion that green looks tilted right to left but it's tilt but in reality it's left to right I mean gravity is what affects everything if I throw a ball in the air it's coming down it's not going to go towards Ray's Creek but talking to Architects about about you know when you're building Greens on steep land they almost look tilted back into the mountain so you know you'll see there's an Indio effect in Palm Desert and but that's just because that that's the low point in these yeah we have mountains and then the green looks tilted back when it's actually tilted the other way and but you're right I do know where I do reference where race Creek is and you know I've the ball is going to go where the slope is but again optical illusions and you need to know because we can't see it we need to know there you have it the science of Master there matches the art of the the speaker for a living you legendary uh folks learn so much I'm sure they want to know more uh please tell them where they can find the ball marker first off and if they want to follow you if the social media website in it that sort of stuff please yes sir um so the website is trueaimarker.com and my email is TT true a marker.com I encourage anybody that has questions about the price the price is a hundred dollars you're not paying for the market you're paying for the technology and the marker the marker is actually a game changer I would not put it out there if I didn't uh was it was didn't work it truly works um if you do the process properly but please don't hesitate to text me or message me I will get back to you I'll probably give you my phone number and have a conversation with it so um I want to help people just as you do this is you know look and I love the fact that I've had the opportunity to help Kurt just a little bit you know he is an elite player and I'm so excited for for his you know for this the end of this season to see how we do um but yeah I want to help golfers and so when I'm not working on the course this is what I do so please don't hesitate to call me and if with questions or text me I'll be seeing you through the year but I'll certainly be seeing you in Atlanta at the Tour Championship thanks for your time I'm about to go order my marker folks do the same Tim Tucker get some rest uh next week's gonna be fun man good luck I appreciate you thank you very much [Music] thank you how's\n"
